# JavaFX---Multi-Option-Selection-Menu

An improved design of selecting multiple options from a ComboBox. 

You select an item and it gets added into a pane from which you can remove it again.  
Selecting an option removes it from the ComboBox.  
All selections are sets so no duplicates are allowed.  
The ComboBox has an "Other..." option which allows you to add a custom test from a TextField.  
If the value you enter exists in the CombBox it gets added directlly.  
If the value is already selected it gets skipped.  

TODO: probably use generics but this is engough for my use case
